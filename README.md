# VISION - acute symptoms resolution

VISION was an observational study conducted in North Carolina surveying adults over a period of 1.5 years. More information on the study can be found at https://globalhealth.unc.edu/covid-19-studies/vision/. As a statistician collaborating with clinician researchers at UNC-CH, we looked to identify which risk factors were most associated with acute symptom resolution.
